                question: "Tell me about your family.",
                answer: "I have 4 family members including myself. My dad is very conservative and strict. I have to observe a curfew of 10 p.m. every night, but thanks to that, I've rarely experienced anything dangerous. My mom is strict, but she has a warm heart. When I have a conflict with my dad, she always takes my side. I have a brother who is 3 years younger. He is tall at 188 cm. He thinks he looks like a Chinese actor Chow Yun-fat, but I absolutely don't think so. He has a dream of becoming an Air Force captain. My family has different personalities, but we get along quite well."

                answer: "In my free time, I enjoy watching movies. I often go to the cinema and watch movies, not just at home. I like action movies, and recently I watched 'Heart of Stone' on NETFLIX. Watching movies is one of my stress relievers, and I go to the theater at least twice a month."

                question: "What are your special skills?",
                answer: "I majored in French and have no problem communicating in French. I always got good grades in my major studies. While in school, I studied in Paris for 6 months, and now I often talk to people in French at the French conversation club. My French skills helped me understand the menu quickly when I worked at a French restaurant in Itaewon, and I was able to serve French customers professionally."

                question: "What is your life motto?",
                answer: "'Work hard, and play hard' is my life motto. I'm passionate about everything and do my best. Even if I work for a long time, I don't get easily tired because a wonderful holiday or vacation is waiting for me. Enjoying every moment is a way not to waste my life. I take on a lot of challenges and don't get too frustrated with failures because there are still plenty of things that I can challenge."

                answer: "Actually, I'm not easily stressed because I'm an easygoing person. However, when I get stressed, I have a special drink. A flight attendant at Cathay Pacific told me how to make it, and it is made by mixing tomato juice and vinegar. The taste is strange at first, but give it a try! After drinking it, I feel much better and relaxed."

I avoid alcohol and try to have regular meals. Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have health supplement food like red ginseng."
